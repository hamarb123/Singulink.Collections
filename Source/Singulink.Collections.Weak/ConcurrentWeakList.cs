/// such environments.</para>
/// <para>Note: all provided big O runtimes are strict, but those above O(log n) assume the case where no new nodes were added by another thread during the
/// operation - if new nodes were added concurrently, it may cause the operation to take longer than expected (e.g., if a concurrent operation happens to
/// always add a new node just after an enumeration's current node, then it will have to loop through all of those until it gets past them).</para>
